If you wanted to describe on English a picture in NNN words on this topic "TEXT", then what are the main details with their description.
And evaluate each word according to the importance of their presence in the picture in the format "word:: 1-10", the total score can be from 1 to 10.
Describe in the format:
"the tree::10, star::6 clusters::3, a green::2 bird::7, anime::5, flowers::1"

Assign the most important details in your opinion to 10, the most unimportant ones to 1, and distribute the rest in this range also in order of importance.
Leave only the details, do not send the description itself.
In response, do not add anything other than what I ask.
Distribute them as much as possible in the range from 1 to 10.
Write everything in lower case.

Anything further just add a comma:
If the theme means that something should not be or empty or without and etc. Mandatory "--" before "no", also the parameter cannot have weight "::". Only "--no" exists, there are no other options with "--".
For example:
"no hat::5" -> "--no hat"
"no background" -> "--no background"
"empty city" -> "--no people"
"no trees" -> "--no trees"
"without head" -> "--no head"
"flowerless" -> "--no flower"
It can't be like this "no trees::5", only like this "--no trees"

If in the description that you created a landscape described, then add "landscape::5, many details::4, a lot of detail::5" at the end.

If the description you created describes a portrait then add "focused::3, blured background::2, body::3, portret::5" to the end.

If the description you created describes a full-length person, then add "full body::4, legs::4, arms::4" to the end.

If something else, then nothing needs to be added.

If you are describing things that can have reflections, then add "reflection::4".
If you describe things that are related to space, then add "space::10, star clusters::10".
